My scene is an open world low-poly viking inspired home. I used all different types of outdoor assets, such as: trees, a wagon, a well, logs, etc. I wasnt inspired by anything directly, because i knew i wanted to do an open world, low-poly scene since i am in love the art style. I found a beautiful asset pack that featured tons of low-poly viking inspired objects that unlitmately gave me inspiration to make me go in the direction i went. The main character in my scene is another low-poly asset I founf on the unity asset store. Its a human model that features rugged leather armor, making the asset fit the viking theme I was going for perfectly!.
